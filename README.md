# User detection
Uses a keylogger to check whether
1. The person typing is typing slower than 70wpm
2. The person is attempting to type in qwerty (I don't use qwerty)

If either of these is true it will lock the computer.

At the moment only 1. has been implemented.

Known issues:
Sometimes the count gets stuck?  Not entirely sure why, has something to do with the special keys check it seems.
